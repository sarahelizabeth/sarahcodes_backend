# Notes

## Backend

`api.sarahcodes.xyz` A record: 24.144.104.232

## Frontend

`sarahcodes.xyz` A or CNAME record: pointing to App Platform IP addres (usually its a CNAME entry to URLs)

## Next steps

1. Iyyaz will try using an internal domain that points to 192.168.0.29
2. Then, try with Caddyserver (which will issue a TLS certificate)
    1. Caddyserver does require a domain name to issue TLS

## Other systems discussed

1. Symfony API Platform (https://api-platform.com)
2. Kong API Gateway
